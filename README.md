# QubSim-Quantum-Circuit-Visualizer-and-Simulator
QubSim is a minimalistic and powerful Quantum Circuit visualizer and simulator made by using Streamlit and Qiskit. It allows users to interactively design, simulate, and visualize quantum circuits in a clean, browser-based interface. No complex learning of the software is required, just basic knowledge of Quantum Circuits! 

**Problem Statement:** IBM has made an open-source library in Python for all the Quantum computer lovers named Qiskit. However, not every physicist or mathematician or even a normal person knows hoe to code. There were also instances when IBM changed a lot of the components of these libraries and intriduced newer versions which it quite difficult for non-coders to cope with the new major updates taking place every now and then. 

**Solution:** To solve this problem, I created QubSim, which is an interactive website that can be used to simulate quantum circuits with absolutely zero knowledge of coding using simple Python. 

Some of its **salient features:**

âœ… Add quantum gates dynamically: Hadamard (H), Pauli-X (X), and CNOT (CX)

ðŸ§© Visual circuit plotting using Matplotlib

ðŸŽ¯ Supports up to 10 qubits

ðŸ“ˆ Real-time measurement results via bar charts

ðŸ”¬ Powered by Qiskit Aerâ€™s QASM simulator

âš¡ Clean UI built with Streamlit
